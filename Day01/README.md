## Day01 of 100 Days of Python
Day 01 is pretty interesting because I just became more flexible to `Pycharm`, `Github repositry`. It is **tough** to understand for the first time. The word *interesting* would be prefect here!
    By the way I am enjoying man I am enjoying!
### What I learned today?
  - A little bit of Pycharm
  - A little bit of GitHub
  - Python Variables
  - Strings
  - `Input()` function
  - `Len()` function

See u next day!
