# Okay Okay! Nothing Jus Warming Up!
# Tired of Printing string and integer or float together?
# Here comes the solution!
# Use F String!
# Taking variables in integer!

a = 5
b = 6
c = 9
print("the result of a + b is= " + str((a +b)) + "the result of b - c is = " + str((b- c)))
# That would give error if i did't add str()
# This is painful, the solution is F_string
print(f"the result of a + b is {a+b} and the result if b - c is {b-c}")
# This one is great! Just use f before double bracket and {} for integer.
