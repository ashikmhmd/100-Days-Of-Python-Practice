# 100-Days-Of-Python-Practice
**I am doing something!**\
I am doing this practice with [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/)
 by taking her [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=ST10MT30325G1) in Udemy. \
 Thank you for the opportunity!
# Why I am not updating repo???
###### I am done with it. I am closing this project of mine and obviously practicing with that course. Beacuse of this course's "construction". I am learning `python` to gain knowledge about computational chemistry. I was seeking course that fundamentally, purposely build for chemists. Chemistry based `python` uses really different different way with some *libraries*. This course doesn't teach any libraries. Biggest **problem** is it's projects, I wanted projects which is related to chemistry at least, but it doesn't have any chemistry baesd projects. But, guess what, I found [another course](https://weisscharlesj.github.io/SciCompforChemists/notebooks/introduction/intro.html)! That's why I am dumping it! Bye Bye! Btw, I have learned some basics here, I am grateful for that but it's time to learn python with real chemitry! :)
