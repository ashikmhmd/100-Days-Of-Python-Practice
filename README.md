**I am doing something!**\

 by taking her [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=ST10MT30325G1) in Udemy. \
 Thank you for the opportunity!
# Why I am not updating repo???
#### I am done with it. I am closing this project of mine and obviously practicing with that course. Beacuse of this course "construction". I am learning `python` for my computational chemistry studies. I was seeking course that fundamentally, purposely build for chemsts. Chemistry based `python` uses really different different *libraries*. This course doesn't taught any libraries. Biggest **problem** is it's projects, I wanted projects which is chemistry related at least, but it doesn't have any chemistry related projects. But, guess what, I found [another course](https://weisscharlesj.github.io/SciCompforChemists/notebooks/introduction/intro.html)! That's why I am dumping it! Bye Bye! Btw, I learned some basics here, I am grateful for that but it's time to learn puthon with chemitry! :)
