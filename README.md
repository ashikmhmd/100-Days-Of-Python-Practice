# Why I am not updating repo???
#### I am done with it. I am closing this project of mine and obviously practicing with that course. Beacuse of this course "construction". I am learning `python` for my computational chemistry studies. I was seeking course that fundamentally, purposely build for chemsts.Chemistry related python uses really different different *libraries*. This course doesn't teach any libraries. Biggest problem is it's projects, I wanted projects which is chemistry related at least, but it doesn't have that. But, guess what, I found [another course](https://weisscharlesj.github.io/SciCompforChemists/notebooks/introduction/intro.html)! That's why I am dumping it! Bye! I learned some basics, but it's time to learn puthon with chemitry!
