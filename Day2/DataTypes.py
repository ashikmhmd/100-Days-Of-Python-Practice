# Data Types

# Integer, Want to print integers?
print(123)
# Just Write like Decimal numbers
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
print(num1 + num2)


# Strings
String = "Ashik"     # This is a String because this is inside double quotation.

# Subscripting
SubscriptVar = "Ashik"[0]   # The number 0 inside square bracket indicates the first character of this string.
SubscriptVar1 = "Ashik"[2]
print(String)       # This output will be  all the Characters.
print(SubscriptVar)     # This output will be one character, the first character.
print(SubscriptVar1)

# for writing large integers we can use underscore like
print(123_345_45_234_111)   # Computer doesn't read underscores

#Float
print(3.1416)


# Want to see what is output type?
print(type("any variable"))        # Just put things in type parantheses
# See Application of type-casting in Challenges file

#Substraction, Division
sub=5-4
div=5/4
print(sub,div)
# to the power
print(2**5)

# Division but doesn't want floats
print(5//2)         # This is called Floor Division output will be 2 instead of 2.5.
# Now if we want specific number of float values
print(round(2.6666, 3))     # By using Round function we can do this, it prints exactly 3 digits.
